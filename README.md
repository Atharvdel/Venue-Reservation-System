  Availability Check: View available venues based on input parameters such as date, city, and number of attendees.

  Database Integration: Stores venue information, including pricing, capacity, and additional services.

  User-Friendly UI: Clean and modern UI with a blue and white color scheme, rounder corners, and well-structured layouts.

  Data Persistence: Venue information is stored locally in an SQL database without requiring a server.
